  <h2 id='life_update_1'>Life update 1</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s Boxing Day and I don&#8217;t care much for shopping so I&#8217;ve been staying home pretty much all day.</p>

<p>I just came back from walking over to Tim Horton&#8217;s for a coffee. It is really cold today, I guess winter is finally coming; sure took long enough. It&#8217;s almost New Years already. I feel a little weird now that this year is ending and all. I feel that I can clearly remember what my life was like around this time last year. I was working in Toronto and living there as well; I got to enjoy the best New Years Party of my life on December 31st, 2011. If it wasn&#8217;t for the minor mistake I made towards the end of the night, I would say it would have been the perfect night. Now, I&#8217;m not so sure if I would be able to have something like that again. Part of the reason I was able to do what I did last year was because I was still involved with a volunteer organization. All of my close friends seem to spend time with their family on New Years, so I didn&#8217;t have anyone else to hang out with then. Now I <em>really</em> don&#8217;t have many people to hang out with on New Years. I don&#8217;t want to admit it, but I&#8217;m really dreading of having a boring New Years Eve. Memories of spending it with my parents while watching TV and waiting for the countdown, only to see my parents falling asleep around 11:30 PM still sticks to my memory quite clearly to this day (and I believe that was quite a few years ago).</p>

<p>Anyways, enough with the rant, here&#8217;s an update on my career.</p>

<p>My contract with LCBO will be over soon. I have three more shifts and then it will be New Years before I get &#8220;fired&#8221;. I had an interview with Apple for a Specialist position over a week ago that I thought went well but still haven&#8217;t heard back from. I went through a similiar experience with the LCBO job offer; I didn&#8217;t hear back from them after my interview for over two weeks, until one day I got a phone call asking me if I wanted the job. So, we&#8217;ll see if history will repeat itself with this potential Apple job offer as well.</p>

<p>I have admit though, working as a Specialist at Apple retail isn&#8217;t what I should be doing right now. I know what I want, I want to be on my way to becoming a Project Manager. I&#8217;ve given it quite a bit of thought into this, and this is the career that meets a lot of my needs. There is a demand for this position, and it allows me to make the best uses of my natural talents while fitting well into my personality. It requires juggling multiple tasks, while making the best uses of my communication skills to speak with my team members and encourage cooperation. Best of all, it allows me to be the center of it all, which means I get to see a little bit of everything. I like that a lot, being able to see the bigger picture, rather than focusing intensely on one part of the project.</p>

<p>So, now I&#8217;m trying to figure out how I&#8217;m going to get what I want. I&#8217;m coming up with a job search plan and working out a system that will help discipline myself to follow through on those plans. Building and maintaining my personal website will be part of that plan. I will write blog entries related to my job search and this will not only help me keep track of things, but also improve my front-end web development skills; something I&#8217;m very much interested in doing as a serious hobby.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now.</p>
