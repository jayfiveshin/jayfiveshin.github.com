  <h2 id='my_strengths_and_weaknesses'>My strengths and weaknesses</h2>

<p>I got the following bullet points from the book <a href='http://www.amazon.ca/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266'>&#8220;Do What You Are&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>It comes from the ESFP personality section, which is appropriate for me, since my personality is ESFP, also known as &#8220;The Performer&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id='strengths'>Strengths:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lots of energy and enjoyment of being active on the job</li>

<li>Ability to adapt well to change and shift gears quickly</li>

<li>Sensitivity to people&#8217;s needs and desire to help them in real ways</li>

<li>Caring nature; cooperative player</li>

<li>Ability to make work fun and exciting</li>

<li>Practicality and great common sense</li>

<li>Loyalty to the people and organizations I care about</li>

<li>Process-oriented approach; creates a lively and fun atmosphere at work</li>

<li>Flexibility and willingness to take calculated risks and try new approaches</li>

<li>Desire to cooperate, pitch in, and help people in real and concrete ways</li>

<li>Ability to clearly assess current resources and conditions and immediately see what needs to be done</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='weaknesses'>Weaknesses:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Difficulty working alone, especially for extended periods of time</li>

<li>Tendency to accept things at face value and miss deeper implications</li>

<li>Dislike of advance preparations; faces trouble organizing time</li>

<li>Difficulty seeing opportunities and options that don&#8217;t exist at the moment</li>

<li>Tendency to take criticism and negative feedback very personally</li>

<li>Trouble making decisions</li>

<li>Impulsiveness and tendency to be easily tempted or distracted</li>

<li>Dislike of excessive rules and structured bureaucracy</li>

<li>Difficulty making logical decisions if they conflict with personal feelings</li>

<li>Resistance to setting long-term goals and difficulty meeting deadlines</li>

<li>Difficulty discipling self or others</li>
</ul>

<p>I think these points suit me quite well. I don&#8217;t really have anything to talk about these points further, other than the fact that it is a surprisingly accurate assessment of my natural born character.</p>
