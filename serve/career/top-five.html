                them up for succcess.</li>
                <li>If a team needs to be created, make sure you are
                involved. You recognize talents, skills, and knowledge in
                people, and that awareness will help you get the right

                <li>Be sure to keep track of ongoing deadlines for your
                many tasks, projects, and obligations. Although you enjoy
                the chance to juggle lots activities, others with less
                powerful Arranger talents may become anxious if they don't
                see you working on their projects frequently. Inform them
                of your progress to ease their fears.</li>

                few routines.</li>

                a large party, or a company celebration.</li>
                <li>Give people time to understand your way of doing
                things when you present it to them. Your mental juggling
                is instinctive, but others might find it difficult to
                break with existing procedures. Take the time to clearly
                explain why your way can be more effective.</li>
                <!-- <li>At work, focus your Arranger talents on the most
                dynamic areas of your organization. Divisions or
                departments that are static and routine in nature are
                likely to bore you. You will thrive when your Arranger

                to the next. If no such levels exist, create them for yourself (

                <li>Because you are not threatening by unfamiliar information, you

                which you are paid to go into new situations and pick up new compentencies
                or languages quickly.</li>
                <li>At work, take advantage of programs that subsidize your learning.
                Your organization may be willing to pay for part or all of your
                instructional coursework or for certifications. Ask your manager for
                information about scholarships and other educational opportunities.
                </li> -->
                <li>Honor your desire to learn. Take advantage of adult educational
                opportunities in your community. Discipline yourself to sign up for

                hits.</li> -->

                <li>Select a vocatoin in which your Individualization talents
                can be both used and appreciated, such as counselling, supervising,
                teaching, or selling. Your ability to see people as unique individuals
                is a special talent.</li>
                <li>Become an expert in describing your own strengths and style.
                For example, answer questions such as: What is the best praise
                you ever received? How often do you like to check in with your
                manager? What is the best method for building relationships? How
                do you learn best? Then ask your colleagues and friends these same questions.
                Help them plan their future by starting with their strengths,
                then designing a future based on what they do best.</li>
                <li>Figure out what every person on your team does best. 
                Then help them capitalize on their talents, skills, and knowledge.
                You may need to explain your rationale and your philosophy so people
                understand that you have their best interests in mind.</li>
                <li>Your presentation and speaking opportunities will be most
                engaging when you relate your topic to the experiences of individuals
                in the audience. Use your Individualization talents to gather and
                share real-life stories that will make your points much better
                than would generic information or theories.</li>
                <li>You move comfortably among a broad range of styles and cultures,
                and you intuitively personalize your interactions. Consciously
                and proactively make full use of these talents by leading diversity
                and community efforts.</li>
