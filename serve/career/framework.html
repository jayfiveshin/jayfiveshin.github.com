  <h3>Life Framework</h3>
  <h4>What is it?</h4>
  <p>
  This is a framework that which I live by. I am free to do anything in my life,
  as long as I am living under this framework. I got the idea to do this after 
  attending a Tech Talk in Toronto about a company and how it thrives by working
  Agile. I thought, "Hmm some of these things are interesting and I think I can
  apply them to my daily life.", so I did.
  </p>
  <h4>Rule 1: Always be asleep before 2 AM</h4>
  <p>
  <b>Rationale:</b> Experience has always confirmed that if I stay up extremely late,
  I always regret it the next day. Not only am I more tired but I feel groggy
  and it ruins the rest of my day. This might be the most important rule of
  them all. It is so basic that without this, the rest of the rule won't really
  matter.<br />
  <b>Exceptions:</b> New Years Eve
  </p>
  <h4>Rule 2: Core working hours are from 10 AM to 4 PM</h4>
  <p>
  <b>Rationale:</b> By establishing core working hours, it allows you to clearly
  establish when you will do work and when you will play. It ensures that you
  don't start feeling overwhelmed by thinking "every hour is working hour, you
  have no time to play". When you start telling yourself that, the natural response
  will be to go against your unrealistic expectations. No one can be working all
  the time with no fun in between.<br />
  <b>Exceptions:</b> When you work for someone else, your employer will likely set
  your working hours for you.<br />
  </p>
  <h4>Meta Rule 1: Always have less than or equal to 10 rules.</h4>
  <p>
  <b>Rationale:</b> More rules mean more things to keep track. If you have more
  than 10 rules (and I do admit, 10 is an arbitrary number that I just thought
  of), you probably have some rules that just aren’t important and it is doing
  you more harm than good. Remember these rules should exist to empower you,
  not to restrain you.
  <p>
  <h4>Meta Rule 2: Make no more one change to the rule per week.</h4>
  <b>Rationale:</b> If you start changing the rule too much, too frequently,
  they lose its significance. What is the point of having rules if you can keep changing them?
  Plus, when you are adding rules, you don’t want to add too many at once,
  otherwise you will start to feel overwhelmed and begin to rebel against
  the self that created these rules for you
