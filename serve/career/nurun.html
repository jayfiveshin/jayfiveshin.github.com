<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<br /><!-- Who are you, and what distinguishes you from other candidates?-->
<p>My name is Joonha Shin and I graduated from University of Waterloo with a degree in Management Engineering this year.</p>
<!-- Why do you want to work for Nurun?-->
<p>I want to work for Nurun because I am interested in digital media and experienced in Project Management. Upon looking through Nurun&#8217;s website, I became convinced that it is a company I would want to work with because I was sold on Nurun&#8217;s fast-paced, open work environment, multicultural diversity, as well as its ability to operate like a small company while actually being a very large organization with a long history. I would like to lend my skills and talents in order to contribute to various fascinating projects which involves creativity and innovation while working with talented, motivated, and friendly team members.</p>
<!-- What are your past experiences?-->
<p>As a recent graduate, my past work experiences come mainly from University of Waterloo&#8217;s unique, multiple four month term, co-op program. I have completed seven co-op terms during my undergraduate years, which is equivalent to little over two and a half years of professional working experience. During this time, I have worked as a Desktop Support, Document Control Specialist, Automated Test Engineer, Project Coordinator, Project Control Officer, Web Entrepreneur, and a Junior Web Developer.</p>
<!-- How are you perfect for this role?-->
<p>While working as a Project Coordinator at Research In Motion, I got my feet wet into the world of Project Management and was coached by a battle-hardened senior Project Manager that truly knew how to get things done. During this time, I took meeting minutes, maintained team website, attended meetings and presented updates to other Project Managers in our team. As a Project Control Officer at CGI Group, I was paired with an Senior Consultant, who worked as a successful Project Manager in the past. Under his guidance, I was not only taught, but experienced first hand, how to control budgets, maintain project schedule, and properly manage risks in a project. Finally, as a Web Entrepreneur, I had a chance to try creating a company with a classmate by building a web application that allowed its visitors to see what cool local events were happening around them. The experienced I gained from doing this allowed me to work for a startup firm in Toronto as a Junior Web Developer for my last co-op term. I got to see how Agile and Extreme Programming methodologies can be successfully implemented in real world, and how a small team of Senior Web Developers and a Product Manager can achieve so much in so little time, all the while having fun working with each other.</p>
<!-- What other cool, useful things could you bring to Nurun?-->
<p>I am a fun and cheerful individual that brings abundance of energy to the people I work with. Because of my easy-going personality, I make friends easily and this has resulted in having a wide range of acquiantances that I&#8217;ve met all throughout my life. My top five skills are talking, meeting people easily, manual dexterity, learning new skills, and adapting to changing situations.</p>
<!-- Availibility and best time to contact me-->
<p>I am available any time of the day starting in January of 2013. Please feel free to call me at 647-889-1882. Unfortunately, I do not have caller ID so I will not be able to call you back in case I miss your call. You can also send me a text message or email me at shin.joonha@gmail.com.</p>
<!-- Closing statements-->
<p>I wish to hear back from you and look forward to the possibility of working with you in the near future.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<br />
<p>Joonha Shin</p>
