  <h3>Overcoming Blocks to Action</h3>
<h4>Three Dimensional Thinking and The Reverse Calendar</h4>
<ol>
  <li>There is no one right place to start. There are several adequate starting points</li>
  <li>Take into account that you will learn and build confidence with each step, as well as asking for help during your progress. 
  You do not need to be competent now at the beginning.</li>
  <li>Stop telling yourself, "you should be finished".
  Don't put yourself down for just starting now.
  You got started and that's what matters.</li>
  <li>Use "The Reverse Calendar"</li>
</ol>
<h4>The work of worrying</h4>
Create a safety net by asking yourself these six questions.
<ol>
  <li>What is the worst that could occur and how likely is it to happen?</li>
  <li>What would I do if the worst really happened? Where would I get help? What would I do to cope?
  Keep asking "then what would I do?", until I know that regardless of what happens, I will continue to do
  my best to carry on.</li>
  <li>How would I lessen the pain and get on with as much happiness as possible, should the worst did occur?
  I am human, vulnerable and imperfect.</li>
  <li>What alternatives would I have?
  I have many ways to be happy and successful.</li>
  <li>What can I do now to lessen the probability of this dreaded event occuring?</li>
  <li>Is there anything I can do now to increase my chances of achieving my goal?</li>
</ol>
<h4>Persistent starting</h4>
Prepare challenges to negative statements and attitudes.
<ol>
  <li>I need to do more preparation before I can start.
  Be alert when preparation becomes procrastination.
  Label any tendency to run to others for advice for outside solutions or further preparation.</li>
  <li>At this rate, I'll never finish.
  As you make progress on your project, there will be large jumps in your learning.</li>
  <li>I should have started earlier.
  You got started and you need to appreciate that.</li>
  <li>There only more work after this.
  Keep this work seperate from your decision about future projects.</li>
  <li>It's not working.
  Difficulties and negative thoughts are not a sign to give up,
  but a signal for you to be creative in either resolving the difficulties or going around it.
  A certain amount of discomfort is natural in stretching beyond our comfort zone into a new level of skill.</li>
  <li>I only need a little more time.
  There is no level of human perfection that will make you invulnerable to criticism and rejection by some people.</li>
</ol>
