###Cover Letter to Nurun (Project Coordinator)
To Whom It May Concern,

<br />
<!-- Who are you, and what distinguishes you from other candidates?-->
My name is Joonha Shin and I graduated from University of Waterloo with
a degree in Management Engineering this year.

<!-- Why do you want to work for Nurun?-->
I want to work for Nurun because I am interested in digital media and
experienced in Project Management. Upon looking through Nurun's website,
I became convinced that it is a company I would want to work with
because I was sold on Nurun's fast-paced, open work environment, multicultural
diversity, as well as its ability to operate like a small company while
actually being a very large organization with a long history.
I would like to lend my skills and
talents in order to contribute to various fascinating projects which
involves creativity and innovation while working with talented,
motivated, and friendly team members.

<!-- What are your past experiences?-->
As a recent graduate, my past work experiences come mainly from University
of Waterloo's unique, multiple four month term, co-op program. I have completed
seven co-op terms during my undergraduate years, which is
equivalent to little over two and a half years of professional working
experience. During this time, I have worked as a Desktop Support,
Document Control Specialist, Automated Test Engineer, Project
Coordinator, Project Control Officer, Web Entrepreneur, and a Junior Web Developer.

<!-- How are you perfect for this role?-->
While working as a Project Coordinator at Research In Motion, I got my
feet wet into the world of Project Management and was coached by a
battle-hardened senior Project Manager that truly knew how to get things
done. During this time, I took meeting minutes, maintained team website,
attended meetings and presented updates to other Project Managers in our
team. As a Project Control Officer at CGI Group, I was paired with
an Senior Consultant, who worked as a successful Project Manager in
the past. Under his guidance, I was not only taught, but experienced
first hand, how to control budgets, maintain project schedule, and
properly manage risks in a project. Finally, as a Web Entrepreneur,
I had a chance to try creating a company with a classmate by building a
web application that allowed its visitors to see what cool local events
were happening around them. The experienced I gained from doing this
allowed me to work for a startup firm in Toronto as a Junior Web
Developer for my last co-op term. I got to see how Agile and Extreme Programming methodologies
can be successfully implemented in real world, and how a small team of
Senior Web Developers and a Product Manager can achieve so much in so little
time, all the while having fun working with each other.

<!-- What other cool, useful things could you bring to Nurun?-->
I am a fun and cheerful individual that brings abundance of energy to
the people I work with. Because of my easy-going personality, I make
friends easily and this has resulted in having a wide range of
acquiantances that I've met all throughout my life. My top five skills
are talking, meeting people easily, manual dexterity, learning new skills,
and adapting to changing situations.

<!-- Closing statements-->
I wish to hear back from you and look forward to the possibility of
working with you in the near future.

Thank you for your time,

<br />
Joonha Shin
