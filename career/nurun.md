To Whom It May Concern,

<!-- Who are you, and what distinguishes you from other candidates?-->
My name is Joonha Shin and I graduated from University of Waterloo with
a degree in Management Engineering this year.

talents in order to contribute to various fascinating projects which
involves creativity and innovation while working with talented,
motivated, open-minded, and friendly team members.

<!-- What are your past experiences?-->
As I am a recent graduate, my past work experiences, relevant to this
position I am applying for, comes mainly from University
of Waterloo's unique four month long co-op program. I have completed
seven different co-op terms during my undergraduate years, which is
equivalent to little over two and a half years of professional working
experience. During this time, I have worked as a Desktop Support,
Document Control Specialist, Automated Test Engineer, Project
Coordinator, Project Control Officer, and as a Junior Web Developer.

<!-- How are you perfect for this role?-->
Many, if not all, of these positions have prepared me for this job for
the following reasons:
* Point 1
* Point 2
* Point 3

<!-- What other cool, useful things could you bring to Nurun?-->
I am a fun and cheerful individual that brings abundance of energy to
the people I work with. Because of my easy-going personality, I make
friends easily and this has resulted in having a wide range of
acquiantances that I've met all throughout my life. My top five skills
pertain to talking, meeting people, manual dexterity, learning new
skills, and adapting to changing situations. I've learned this about
myself from self-reflecting for the past few months and reading up on
personality based psychology books<sup><a href="#psych_books" id="fn1">1</a></sup> and online sources.

<!-- Closing statements-->
I wish to hear back from you and look forward to the possibility of
working with you in the near future.

Thank you for your time,

Joonha Shin
