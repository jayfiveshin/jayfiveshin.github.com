          <li>I am flexible, in how I organize people and how I configure
          space.</li>
          <li>I need to be in a dynamic area of an organization. Routine, static part 
          of an organization drains my energy.</li>

              <!-- <li>Learn the goals of coworkers and friends. Let them
              know that you are aware of their goals, and then help set
              them up for succcess.</li>
              <li>If a team needs to be created, make sure you are
              involved. You recognize talents, skills, and knowledge in
              people, and that awareness will help you get the right
              people in the right spots</li>
              <li>Your intuitively sense how different people can work
              together. Take a close look at groups wtih divergent
              personalities and opinions, as they have the greatest need
              for your Arranger talents.</li> -->
              <li>Be sure to keep track of ongoing deadlines for your
              many tasks, projects, and obligations. Although you enjoy
              the chance to juggle lots activities, others with less
              powerful Arranger talents may become anxious if they don't
              see you working on their projects frequently. Inform them
              of your progress to ease their fears.</li>
              <li>Seek complex, dynamic environments in which there are
              few routines.</li>
              <li>Take on the organization of a big event; a convention,
              a large party, or a company celebration.</li>
              <li>Give people time to understand your way of doing
              things when you present it to them. Your mental juggling
              is instinctive, but others might find it difficult to
              break with existing procedures. Take the time to clearly
              explain why your way can be more effective.</li>
              <!-- <li>At work, focus your Arranger talents on the most
              dynamic areas of your organization. Divisions or
              departments that are static and routine in nature are
              likely to bore you. You will thrive when your Arranger
              talents are energized, and you will suffer when you are
              bored.</li>
              <li>Help others see your far-reaching expertise by sharing
              your "what if" thinking with them. When they know you've
              identified and carefully considered all possible options
              and arrangements, they'll feel more confident.</li> -->
              <li>Figure out how you can
              improve workflow by rearranging space and/or procedures to
              maximize efficiency and to free up time for you and for
              others.</li>
