        I thrive in situations where I have many things going on at the same
        time.<br />
        I am flexible, in how I organize people and how I configure space.<br />
        I need to be in a dynamic area of an organization. Routine, static part 
        of an organization drains my energy.<br />
        I am always looking for the perfect configuration.<br />

        I live in the moment. I don't resent sudden requests.<br />
        I am a very flexible person that can stay productive when demands of
        work are pulling me in many directions at once.<br />
        I enjoy roles which success depends on responding to constantly changing
        circumstances.<br />
        I try to avoid tasks that are too structured and stifle my need for
        variety.<br />
        I am most productive on short term assignments that requires immediate
        action.<br />
        I prefer life with quick skirmishes rather than long drawn out
        campaigns.<br />

        I am sensitive to the emotions of others / I can sense the emotions of
        those around me.<br />
        I can easily gauge the emotional tone of a room; I have the talent to
        forge a bridge of understanding and mutual support.<br />
        People are drawn to me because I help them give voice to their emotional
        life.<br />
        I hear the unvoiced questions, and I anticipate the needs of others.<br />

        I am intrigued by the unique qualities of each person, I focus on the

        Because of my keen observation of other's strengths, I can draw out the
        best in each person, which helps me build productive teams.<br />
        I move comfortably around broad range of style and cultures, and
        intuitively personalize my interaction.<br />
