            <li>I am flexible, in how I organize people and how I configure
            space.</li>
            <li>I need to be in a dynamic area of an organization. Routine, static part 
            of an organization drains my energy.</li>

              <ol>
                <!-- <li>Learn the goals of coworkers and friends. Let them
                know that you are aware of their goals, and then help set
                them up for succcess.</li>
                <li>If a team needs to be created, make sure you are
                involved. You recognize talents, skills, and knowledge in
                people, and that awareness will help you get the right
                people in the right spots</li>
                <li>Your intuitively sense how different people can work
                together. Take a close look at groups wtih divergent
                personalities and opinions, as they have the greatest need
                for your Arranger talents.</li> -->
                <li>Be sure to keep track of ongoing deadlines for your
                many tasks, projects, and obligations. Although you enjoy
                the chance to juggle lots activities, others with less
                powerful Arranger talents may become anxious if they don't
                see you working on their projects frequently. Inform them
                of your progress to ease their fears.</li>
                <li>Seek complex, dynamic environments in which there are
                few routines.</li>
                <li>Take on the organization of a big event; a convention,
                a large party, or a company celebration.</li>
                <li>Give people time to understand your way of doing
                things when you present it to them. Your mental juggling
                is instinctive, but others might find it difficult to
                break with existing procedures. Take the time to clearly
                explain why your way can be more effective.</li>
                <!-- <li>At work, focus your Arranger talents on the most
                dynamic areas of your organization. Divisions or
                departments that are static and routine in nature are
                likely to bore you. You will thrive when your Arranger
                talents are energized, and you will suffer when you are
                bored.</li>
                <li>Help others see your far-reaching expertise by sharing
                your "what if" thinking with them. When they know you've
                identified and carefully considered all possible options
                and arrangements, they'll feel more confident.</li> -->
                <li>Figure out how you can
                improve workflow by rearranging space and/or procedures to
                maximize efficiency and to free up time for you and for
                others.</li>

            <div class="modal-body">
              <ol>
                <li>Refine how you learn. For example, you might learn best by
                teaching; if so, seek out opportunities to present to others. You
                might learn best through quiet reflection; if so, find this quiet
                time.</li>
                <li>Develop ways to track the progress of your learning. If there
                are distinct levels or stages of learning within a discipline or
                skill, take a moment to celebrate your progression from one level
                to the next. If no such levels exist, create them for yourself (
                e.g., reading five books on the subject or making three presentations
                on the subject).</li>
                <li>Be a catalyst for change. Others might be intimidated by new rules,
                new skills, or new circumstances. Your willingness to soak up this
                newness can calm their fears and spur them to action. Take this
                responsibility seriously.</li>
                <!-- <li>Seek roles that require some form of technical competence.
                You will enjoy the process of acquiring and maintaining this expertise.
                </li>
                <li>As far as possible, shift your career toward a field with
                constantly changing technologies or regulations. You will be energized
                by the challenge of keeping up.</li>
                <li>Because you are not threatening by unfamiliar information, you
                might excel in a consulting role (either internal or external) in
                which you are paid to go into new situations and pick up new compentencies
                or languages quickly.</li>
                <li>At work, take advantage of programs that subsidize your learning.
                Your organization may be willing to pay for part or all of your
                instructional coursework or for certifications. Ask your manager for
                information about scholarships and other educational opportunities.
                </li> -->
                <li>Honor your desire to learn. Take advantage of adult educational
                opportunities in your community. Discipline yourself to sign up for
                at least one new academic or adult learning courses each year.</li>
                <li>Time disappears and your attention intensifies when you are
                immersed in studying or learning. Allow yourself to "follow the trail"
                by scheduling learning sessions during periods of time that will
                not be interrupted by pressing engagements.</li>
