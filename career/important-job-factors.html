<h3>Important Job Factors</h3>
<p>
<ol class="heavy">
  <li>Position</li>
  <p>I want to work as a Project Manager. However, I understand I may
  need to work as a Project Coordinator initially in order to learn from a more 
  experienced Project Manager who will show me the ropes before I can work as 
  as Project Manager myself.</p>
  <li>Environment</li>
  <p>I would like to work indoors. I prefer workplaces that are open concept,
  without cubicles. I prefer busy versus calm environment, since I want to be 
  "on the go" as much as possible.</p>
  <li>Fulfillment</li>
  <p>It is important for me to believe that my work is meaningful and important.
  I like being the center of the project, where everyone on the project is looking
  at me for answers. I want to be the person that brings many people of different 
  skill sets together.</p>
  <li>Work preferences</li>
  <p>It is important for me to work on a project from beginning to end, but I
  don't think it would be a deal breaker, if I was to not have this. I prefer to
  work on one project at time that requires several different tasks. It is very 
  important for me to see the result of my work. It is not very crucial for me 
  to be seen as a very creative person (right now). I enjoy the process of
  making something that seems ambiguous into something that is well thought out 
  and clearly outlined. I prefer more variety in my work.</p>
  <li>Competence & responsibility level</li>
  <p>I want to be involved in work that requires high level of skill and
  knowledge, however, I'm not too concerned about high level of education. 
  I want to take on more leadership roles as I advance.</p>
  <li>Challenge</li>
  <p>What challenges me is my ability to work well with people and understand
  what I can do to make people work well together and make great products or 
  achieve great things together as a team. In the Project Management position,
  I will have the opportunity to make important decisions. I hope that I will be
  called on to grow and to develop new skills and areas of knowledge because 
  I love learning, and I constantly want to be learning new things.</p>
  <li>Work relationships</li>
  <p>I work best with young people, in their mid-20's to late 30's. It is very 
  important for me to develop relationships with the people I work with. I want 
  to be working alone 25% of the time, and working with team members 75% of the
  the time. I want to be constantly interacting with others (hopefully people I
  work well with).</p>
  <li>Advancement potential</li>
  <p>There are many advancement potential for Project Management, especially 
  since being a good Project Manager requires working well with many people and
  being able to lead a team very well. This can easily transitions into the 
  necessary skills for being in senior management.</p>
  <li>Learning opportunities</li>
  <p>There are tons of learning opportunities in this position. As of now, I am
  inexperienced and unknowledgeable, but I will most likely suck of knowledge
  like a sponge in my first two years at work. There are also plenty of training
  available such as PMI Certification, and also getting my MBA, in order to 
  further advance my career. Financial support will be available if I am working
  for a reputatable company.</p>
  <li>Salary/security</li>
  <p>Salary will be somewhat important for me later on, but as of now, I'm not 
  too concerned about making sure I have a very high salary right from the 
  beginning. I do however, want to be making enough money to move out of my
  parent's house and live with my best friend.</p>
  <li>Prestige/status</li>
  <p>I didn't know this about myself before, but I realize now that I do care 
  quite a bit about the prestigiousness of my position title. Luckily, Project
  Manager is a title I can live with.</p>
  <li>Hours required</li>
  <p>I prefer flexible working hours, but I can live with regular hours as well.
  I am willing to commit to late night work days, but it is important for me to 
  have a great balance between my work life and my personal life, which means consistently burning the proverbial
  "midnight oil" is not something I am willing to do for prolonged period of time.</p>
  <li>Geographic location</li>
  <p>I want to work in the city. I prefer Toronto, but I am also willing to work
  in booming cities in US. I want to cut down my commute time to no more than 
  an 2 hours per day (in total).</p>
  <li>Travel/relocation</li>
  <p>I do not want to be constantly travelling. However, ocassionally travelling
  is okay. I do not want to be relocated, unless it's a city that I like more 
  than the place I am currently working at.</p>
