I got the following bullet points from the book ["Do What You Are"](http://www.amazon.ca/Do-What-You-Are-Personality/dp/0316167266).

It comes from the ESFP personality section, which is appropriate for me, since my personality is ESFP, also known as "The Performer".
###Strengths:
* Lots of energy and enjoyment of being active on the job
* Ability to adapt well to change and shift gears quickly
* Sensitivity to people's needs and desire to help them in real ways
* Caring nature; cooperative player
* Ability to make work fun and exciting
* Practicality and great common sense
* Loyalty to the people and organizations I care about
* Process-oriented approach; creates a lively and fun atmosphere at work
* Flexibility and willingness to take calculated risks and try new approaches
* Desire to cooperate, pitch in, and help people in real and concrete ways
* Ability to clearly assess current resources and conditions and immediately see what needs to be done

###Weaknesses:
* Difficulty working alone, especially for extended periods of time
* Tendency to accept things at face value and miss deeper implications
* Dislike of advance preparations; faces trouble organizing time
* Difficulty seeing opportunities and options that don't exist at the moment
* Tendency to take criticism and negative feedback very personally
* Trouble making decisions
* Impulsiveness and tendency to be easily tempted or distracted
* Dislike of excessive rules and structured bureaucracy
* Difficulty making logical decisions if they conflict with personal feelings
* Resistance to setting long-term goals and difficulty meeting deadlines
* Difficulty discipling self or others

I think these points suit me quite well. I don't really have anything to
talk about these points further, other than the fact that it is a
surprisingly accurate assessment of my natural born character.
