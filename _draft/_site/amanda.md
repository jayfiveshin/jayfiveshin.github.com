We first met in beginner's acting class more than a year
ago. Since that time, she decided to pursue acting further and I didn't.
She's been doing this for just over a year, and she explained to me how difficult it
has been since. As she told stories of her experiences, I felt both fear and
excitement from her voice. She knew she wasn't sure of what she was doing and
the uncertainty of whether or not she'll "make it" was taking its toll.
As she spoke, I couldn't help but find her irresistibly charming.
It could have been her long curly hair, her luscious full lips, or her
body, that constantly made people turn heads. But on top of all
that, I was captivated by the fact that despite fear, she was pursuing something she
loved doing. Right at that moment, I saw something in her that I wanted
for myself: the courage to step forward.

After talking for an hour, it was time for us to go see a play together.
We were running late, and because it was just pouring minutes ago, all taxis
seemed too busy to respond our SOS. In an act of desperation, we rushed to grab our 
things, then stormed out of her
apartment and marched towards the nearest subway station.
The ride was quick, yet we still had to walk quite a bit when we got off our stop.
It had just stopped raining, but it was still humid; almost as if we
were in a rainforest. "Can you run?" I asked impolitely.
Before saying a word, we both looked at her shoes.
We started walking slightly faster.

With no more than a minute to spare, we made it inside the building,
only to find out that the play has been delayed for thirty minutes to
accommodate for the people running late.
Regardless, we smiled it off and brushed the sweat off our foreheads.
I waited in anticipation of what was to come, and occasionally made
small talks with other guests, who were also waiting patiently for the
act to start.

They rounded us up and led us up the stairs. When we finally arrived in
the room where the act would take place, I saw a man who seemed to be in
his mid-twenties, lying down awkwardly on a one-seater couch with his
eyes closed. The
background music was loud enough to notice, but quiet enough to
tune out with time. Soon the lights started to dim, and I
could make out a shadow figure burned onto a wall of cloth.
The figure started to speak, in a loud, commanding voice.

*"This play is 90 minutes long. There is no intermission.
Please turn off your cellphones, pagers and whatsoever. If your phone does
go off during the play, I will come out and I will hurt you."*

I reached deeply into my pockets and fumbled around the sides of my
phone to double check that it was in silent mode. It was. With one large
breath, I braced for impact and made myself comfortable ontop of a tiny
black chair. But I was not ready for what I was about to see.

The play was intense, and overflowing with emotions and drama. There was
no time to come up for air, no comic relief. From the beginning to the end, it
was full-throttle, never letting up on gas. During the moment, I didn't
enjoy the experience because I felt uneasy. I kept shifting
around in my chair. Unable to sit still and appreciate the work of art
unravel in front of me. I wanted to get up and stand, to walk around
and be in motion. But once the play was over, all I wanted to do was to sit
down and think about what I had just witnessed. As I mulled over this experience,
I started to recall something. A truth that I had once known, but chose to forget.

It all came rushing back, memories of the time when I finally found what I was looking for, only
to realize that I did not have the confidence, nor the courage to step
forward. Memories of feeling awake, after having been asleep for years.
These were memories that I had deeply buried inside my heart, not knowing when they will re-surface, but
because it was "necessary", I had smothered this newborn child of mine
hoping that its cries will eventually fall deaf to my ears.

But as soon as the play ended, my attempt at quietly living a normal life
proved to be a spectacular failure.  Twelve months of silencing undone in just ninety
minutes! I was instantly bothered by what I had done, but more importantly,
horrified by what I had failed to do for months. I've been financially independent for close to
six months now, why haven't I taken another acting course? Why haven't I
read any of the emails from the various acting orgnizations I've
signed up for?
Why haven't I taken one step towards making my dreams a reality?
I felt gulity, sad, angry and betrayed. I had swallowed
a cocktail of dark emotions that I could taste but unable to digest. I would stand then sit,
then stand again, only to sit down, over and over.

Next day, like a dog
that's been abandoned by his owner, I wandered around the office for hours,
waiting for the clock to run out so that I could be in a place of
comfort and silence in order to pick up the broken pieces and try again.
