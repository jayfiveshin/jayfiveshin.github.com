*Just when you think that you have your entire life figured out, it has
a way of throwing a curve ball.*

I had a bit of a crisis today.

I questioned my life choices. I asked
questions like, *"Who have I been in the last few weeks? Last few months?"*, *"Have I really
been true to myself?"*  I couldn't figure out who I
was or what I was doing. I was in terrible shape, and I was doing
everything I can to keep it to myself but it was unbearable.

Have you ever
felt that way? One moment you are perfectly fine with your existence;
then in another moment you are completely thrown out of track. What
causes something like this happen? I wondered. 

I had a problem, and like any good engineer, I
wanted to fix it, but only way I could
was to first understand why I was having these problems in the first
place.

I realized what caused this were two things: first thing is that last night, I met up with a
friend whom I've met in a beginner's acting class. Since we last met,
she decided to pursue acting further and I didn't. Through our
interactions, I felt that she was scared. She wasn't sure of what she
was doing and the uncertainty was taking its toll on her mind. 
But I saw something beautiful in a person who was fearful, but decided to do
it anyway.

The second thing was that we went to go see a
play together. The play was extremely intense, and so full of
emotions. I was more shocked than amazed. I did not really
enjoy the experience, because I couldn't help but feel uneasy. I kept shifting
around in my chair. Unable to sit still and watch the artwork
happening in front of me. I wanted to get up and stand, to walk around
and be part of the scene. Then once the play was over, I wanted to sit
down, and think about what I had just witnessed. It was the oddest thing
I've experienced in a long time. As I mulled over this experience, an idea was planted in my
head.

*"A truth that I had once known, but chose to forget."*

I had dug up something that I've deeply buried long time ago.
And the next day this so called truth lit up in flames, which then
spread like wildfire across the field of my mind and continued to burn for hours on end, and
never let me have a quiet moment of peace.

The truth that upon searching for so dearly, I had finally found something that I loved doing; an
activity, in the most purely sense. Self-expression.

The truth that I had ran away from what I had desperately yearned for, all beacuse I was
fearful of shame, failure and rejection.

Artist and Engineer, both are something that I want to be a part of.
Both are something that I want to be. Yet, at first glace, the two seems
so unlike each other. My formal education is in Engineering, but who I
am as a human being is in Artistry. Ever since I was a kid, I was
drawing and buliding things. Both were forms of artistic expression of
myself. the only thing that matter was the tool in which I used to
express myself.

Expression; that is the word that she used to describe the reason. The
reason why she does what she does. And perhaps it is the same lack of it
that brings such pain in my heart.

We all have the capacity, the desire and finally, the need to express
ourselves. It is in our nature; because we are not machines, we are
human beings. We have hearts, we have emotions, we have feelings that we
just cannot deny. No matter how hard we try to become something we are
not, we will fall short. And one day the reality will catch up with us.

Expression; it is the reason why I was able to do what I do for so long.
Without being able to express myself, my thoughts, my feelings, I would
have been dead a long ago. What is the point of my existence? The
ultimate reason is that we do not matter. We are just another life form
on this planet. We only matter to our individual
selves. The so called 'ego', if often my main motivator and it is the
reason why so many of us choose to do the things that we do.
