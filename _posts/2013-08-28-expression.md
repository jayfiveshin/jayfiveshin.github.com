*Just when you think that you have your entire life figured out, it has
a way of throwing a curve ball.*

I had a bit of a crisis today. I questioned my life choices. I asked
questions like, "Who was I in the last few weeks?" Am I really being
true to myself? Why did I care so much? I couldn't figure out who I
was or what I was doing. Have you ever
felt that way? One moment you are perfectly fine with your existence;
then in another moment you are completely thrown out of track.

It felt a little bit like it was my first day of high school; and I can
assure you that was not a good day for me. Why do you think that I keep
questioning myself? I don't allow myself to be the person that I really
am. I see another person and I feel that I need to be like tha person. I
am me, and I'm not no one else. Why do I have such a hard time accepting
that fact?

Artist and Engineer, both are something that I want to be a part of.
Both are something that I want to be. Yet, at first glace, the two seems
so unlike each other. My formal education is in Engineering, but who I
am as a human being is in Artistry. Ever since I was a kid, I was
drawing and buliding things. Both were forms of artistic expression of
myself. the only thing that matter was the tool in which I used to
express myself.

Expression; that is the word that she used to describe the reason. The
reason why she does what she does. And perhaps it is the same lack of it
that brings such pain in my heart.

We all have the capacity, the desire and finally, the need to express
ourselves. It is in our nature; because we are not machines, we are
human beings. We have hearts, we have emotions, we have feelings that we
just cannot deny. No matter how hard we try to become something we are
not, we will fall short. And one day the reality will catch up with us.

Expression; it is the reason why I was able to do what I do for so long.
Without being able to express myself, my thoughts, my feelings, I would
have been dead a long ago. What is the point of my existence? The
ultimate reason is that we do not matter. We are just another life form
on this planet. We only matter to our individual
selves. The so called 'ego', if often my main motivator and it is the
reason why so many of us choose to do the things that we do.
