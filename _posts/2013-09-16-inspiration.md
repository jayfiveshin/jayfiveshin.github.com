I'm constantly looking for some kind of an inspiration to take me away
when I'm writing. However, I think the mistake that I've been making is
that I am who I am and writing about myself and my reality is what I'm
good at. I should not have to betray myself for the sake of being
something that I'm not. What I strive for can't come at the cost of
betraying the person that I was meant to be.

I'm not a very happy person when I am sick. Over the last weekend, I
felt very sick and I think it was because I had too much alcohol on
Friday night. I read over the symptoms that I had and it seems more
closely aligned with food poisoning rather than alcohol poisoning. But I
find this hard to believe because the only thing that I ate that night
was pizza, which plenty of other people had, but didn't get sick. Did I
eat anything other than that afterward? I may have, but I might not
remember.

I still don't feel very good. This isn't good. It's sad that I need get
sick to realize just how much I enjoy being healthy. When you are not
feeling well, it's pretty much the only thing you ever want. You just
want to be healthy again.

If I could fit additional hundred years to my life, I would not be able to do
something better than someone who is currently the world's best. The
point of bettering myself at something is not so that I can become the
best, it's because it would better my situation. When it comes to
programming and web development, I need to rid of this idea that if I don't
become the best there is, there is no point to it. It isn't true.

I'm twenty-five years old. Who am I supposed to be at this point in my life? What
were some of my goals when I was twenty years old? What about when I was
fifteeen? What will be my goal when I'm thirty years old? What about
thirty-five?

What do I even need goals? Why do I need expectations? Wouldn't life be
much simpler if I just lived? If I just existed without goals in life?
What that be a good way to live?

No. I don't think I would be very happy. I would need some kind of a
goal in life. Something to strive towards. Something that I need to
achieve. My life's work, I would say. On my deathbed, I will say "My
work is done. I have no regrets", then die a glorious death, a worthy
death.

Some people live their whole lives planning how they will live. But
because they are always planning, they never really get a chance to live.
Living, for a human being, is not one particular event, but rather a
series of events interwoven by time. If you spend all of your life planning on
how to live it, you'll never really live.

Death, however, is one event. An event no man nor woman ever escapes. It
is something worth planning for. It is something worth envisioning your
whole life. I will live my whole life planning how I will die.
And I will die the way I want to die.
