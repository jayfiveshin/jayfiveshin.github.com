I'm constantly looking for some kind of an inspiration to take me away
when I'm writing. However, I think the mistake that I've been making is
that I am who I am and writing about myself and my reality is what I'm
good at. I should not have to betray myself for the sake of being
something that I'm not, something that I may strive for.

I want to be the best that I can be, because I realize that I cannot
change who I am, but I can always be more of who I am.

I'm not a very happy person when I am sick. Over the last weekend, I
felt very sick and I think it was because I had too much alcohol on
Friday night. I read over the symptoms that I had and it seems more
closely aligned with food poisoning rather than alcohol poisoning. But I
find this hard to believe because the only thing that I ate that night
was pizza, which plenty of other people had, but didn't get sick. Did I
eat anything other than that afterward? I may have, but I might not
remember.

I'm not going to pretend that I'm some kind of a fancy artist, because
I'm not. I've always been the type of person that wrote what I see, what
I hear and what I can touch. I'm not the idealist. I'm the realist. I am
not going to betray myself.

I still don't feel very good. This isn't good. It's sad that I need get
sick to realize just how much I enjoy being healthy. When you are not
feeling well, it's pretty much the only thing you ever want. You just
want to be healthy again.
