*"Expression."*

That is the word that she used to describe her reason; the
justification for why she was doing what she was doing. And perhaps it was
due to my realization that I was lacking such a thing in my life that suddenly
brought a sharp, twisting pain in my chest.

From time to time, I used to I wonder about the point of our existence.
To me, it seemed to matter very little. We are one of many life forms
on this planet, and if all of humanity were to be wiped out, this planet
will still move on without us. Most likely,
all other forms of life on earth would thrive, and with time,
things will be as if we never existed.

Regardless, we are here; I don't know how or why, but we exist. And thus the grim, yet somehow beautiful, reality
is that we are responsible for creating our own reasons for
living and those reasons will be, and should be, different for every individual.
The grimness comes from the fact that those who fail to find their own reason to live
for a prolonged period of time often comtemplate suicide, and sometimes
succeed.

To be *happy* can be one's goal in life and for many people, their reason for living is to
achieve this goal. Even so, what makes an individual happy will
vary. For example, mine is when I'm able to express myself to others; without the
ability to express my thoughts and my feelings, I would have been dead long ago.

But sometimes we get caught up with what *seems* to makes other people happy
and fall into the trap of beliveing that we must also do what they do in
order to be happy.

'Have a I fallen into this trap as well?' I thought to myself as we
walked back from the play. There was a small moment of silence,
but not for long. She wasn't the type to let a situation go too long
without any words being exchanged.
