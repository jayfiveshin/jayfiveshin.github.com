I met up with a friend that I met in beginner's acting class more than a year
ago. Since we last met, she decided to pursue acting further and I didn't.
She's been doing this for just over a year, and she told me how difficult it
has been since. As she told me of her experiences, I felt both fear and
excitement from her voice. She knew she wasn't sure of what she was doing and
the uncertainty of whether or not she'll "make it" was taking its toll.
But I found beauty in her for pursuing something she was fearful of.
I saw something in her that I wanted for myself: the courage to step forward.

After talking for an hour, we went to go see a play together.
The play was intense, and overflowing with emotions and drama. There was
no time to come up for air, no comic relief. From the beginning to the end, it
was full-throttle, never letting up on gas. During the moment, I didn't
enjoy the experience because I felt uneasy. I kept shifting
around in my chair. Unable to sit still and appreciate the moment as the artwork
unraveled in front of me. I wanted to get up and stand, to walk around
and be part of the scene. But once the play was over, all I wanted to do was to sit
down and think about what I had just witnessed. As I mulled over this experience,
I started to recall something. *The truth that I had once known, but chose to forget.*

I dug up something that I've deeply buried in my mind. The reason why I
left Canada to embark on a journey without a cause, the reason why I was
in such scarred and in bad shape after graduating from university. It
was all coming back to me like a wall of bricks hitting me on the side
of my head. Then it started a small fire in my heart, and continued to
burn for days and nights, never letting me have a moment of peace.

The truth that upon searching for so dearly, I had finally found something that I loved doing; an
activity, in the most purely sense. Self-expression.

The truth that I had ran away from what I had desperately yearned for, all beacuse I was
fearful of shame, failure and rejection.

Artist and Engineer, both are something that I identify with;
both are roles that I want to play in life. Yet, at first glace, the two seems
so unlike each other. My formal education may be in Engineering, but
the discipline that I identify myself with has already been in Artisty.

Art; ever since I was a kid, I was
drawing and buliding things. In my eyes, both are forms of expression of
the self. The only thing that was different was the tool in which I used to
express myself.

Expression; that is the word that she used to describe the reason. The
reason why she does what she does. And perhaps it is the same lack of it
that brought such pain in my heart.

We all have the capacity, the desire and finally, the need to express
ourselves. It is in our nature; because we are not machines, we are
human beings. We have hearts, we have emotions, we have feelings that we
just cannot deny. No matter how hard we try to become something we are
not, we will fall short. And one day the reality will catch up with us.

Expression; it is the reason why I was able to do what I do for so long.
Without being able to express myself, my thoughts, my feelings, I would
have been dead a long ago. What is the point of my existence? The
ultimate reason is that we do not matter. We are just another life form
on this planet. We only matter to our individual
selves. The so called 'ego', if often my main motivator and it is the
reason why so many of us choose to do the things that we do.
