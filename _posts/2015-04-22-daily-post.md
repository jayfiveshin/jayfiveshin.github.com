I would like this to be a place where I keep track of all my thoughts.
At the same time, I don't want this to be a dump of random things that
pop into my head; I want this to be semi-polished in terms of technique,
but I do not want to be restricted in anyway in terms of content. I
should not be afraid to write what must be said. I don't need to accept
all passing thoughts. Some I could entertain without letting in, and
others I can take more time and elaborate on what I mean.

I always know when I am about to have a burst of creative energy. I'm
talking about a piece of writing that I know is going to excite me. It
is almost like the writing just writes itself. There requires no
planning, it just kind of happenes. Sometimes it can take a while to
finish, other times it becomes completed rather quickly.

I think the most important thing is that I do not force this process.
